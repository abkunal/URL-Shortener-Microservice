### User Stories  
  
1. I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.  
  
2. If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.  
  
3. When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.  
  
Thanks for taking a look!
